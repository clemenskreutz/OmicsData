Class folder @OmicsData

This folder should contain the following functions:
- Either functions overwriting other common Matlab functions, e.g. min, max, log2, ...
- Or functions which requires access to the class fields, e.g. to O.data, O.rows, O.config.  Please use this syntax sparsely, i.e. only if required. Usage of get and set is preferred. An example is OmicsCheck.m
